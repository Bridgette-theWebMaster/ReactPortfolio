      <p>
        I am an industrious web developer inspired by what I don't already know.
        Driven by curiosity and tenacity, I enjoy challenging myself to build
        progressive apps using new and/or unfamiliar technology. I have
        expansive knowledge of both back and front end development, and have
        proven to be adaptive while working in various environments.
