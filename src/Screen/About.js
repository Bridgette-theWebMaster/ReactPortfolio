      <p>
        I am an industrious software engineer inspired by what I don't already
        know. Driven by curiosity and tenacity, I enjoy challenging myself to
        build progressive apps using new and/or unfamiliar technology. I have
        expansive knowledge of both back and front end development, and have
        proven to be adaptive while working in various environments. In the time
        that I have been developing, my top accomplishments are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Written multiple full stack web app using PERN stack</li>
        <li>Successfully deployed both front and back end code</li>
        <li>Experience with AWS S3</li>
        <li>Written and used RESTful APIs</li>
        <li>Experience with CLIs and version control</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        There is so much to experience and learn in the world and my biggest
        dreams are to see and experience as much of life as possible. I am an
        avid traveler and will take any opportunity I can to immerse myself in
        cultures different from my own. Recently, safe travel has not been a
        possibility and my pervious career is now virtually non-existent, this
        has given me the opportunity to focus on the things I enjoy doing like
        playing video games, solving puzzles, and hanging out with my four
        legged babies. I have been able to begin my pursuit as a software
        engineer and I am excited about what where the future will lead me.
